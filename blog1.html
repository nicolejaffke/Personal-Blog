      A whole new space for my thoughts, stories, experiences, and educational
      content! I'm excited to share more with you all and to continue to expand
      my reach beyond just the physical limitations of my business. These blogs
      will be physical therapy, athletic training, personal training, and
      running focused. They will be designed to help you solve a problem, teach
      you about something new you maybe didn't know, connect with you, and give
      you an insight into what I do. I will absolutely be taking requests for
      topics you want to know about! My plan is to keep these fun, light,
      interesting, and easy to read. Stay tuned for the first "real" blog post
      coming later this week :)

      Thanks for being a part of my Affinity Family!
